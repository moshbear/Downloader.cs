This is a simple batch downloader, written for .NET 3.5.

While it wors in Mono, UI update is laggy and the progress log
is rendered unusable. A planned mono check will convert progress
log to use a logfile insteead.

Note: does not yet compile in Mono, as I can't get the
using System.Windows.Forms;
line to not choke the dmcs.
